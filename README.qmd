## Overview

`LogoShapes` is a library of [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics). It offers scalable, editable versions of [NetLogo's iconic shapes](https://docs.netlogo.org/shapes.html) as well as new designs, enabling you to customize visuals for simulations and educational materials without loss of quality.

> If you find this project useful, please consider giving it a star! &nbsp; [![GitHub repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/danielvartan/logoshapes)](https://github.com/danielvartan/logoshapes/)

> The continuous development of `LogoShapes` depends on community support. If you can afford to do so, please consider becoming a sponsor. &nbsp; [![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sponsor&message=%E2%9D%A4&logo=GitHub&color=%23fe8e86)](https://github.com/sponsors/danielvartan)

## Usage

Shapes are provided in both [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) and [NetLogo XML](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/XML-File-Format) formats. You can browse them in the repository’s [`svg`](https://github.com/danielvartan/logoshapes/tree/main/svg/) and [`xml`](https://github.com/danielvartan/logoshapes/tree/main/xml/) directories.

```{=gfm}
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please credit this project and the original creators when using shapes from this collection. Shapes without specific attribution were created by the project author. For details, see the [License](#license) section.
```

            src = x,

### NetLogo 7.0.3

All 230 shapes from [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) 7.0.3 are included.

See [NetLogo's licensing information](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/blob/main/shared/resources/main/system/about.txt) for details on usage rights.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

here("svg", "netlogo-7-0-3") |>
  dir_ls() |>
  path_rel(here()) |>
  create_svg_shapes_table()
```

### Corey Brady Shapes

These shapes were created by [Corey Brady](https://forum.netlogo.org/t/making-turtle-shapes/578/), who shared them on the [NetLogo Users Forum](https://forum.netlogo.org/). Corey has generously permitted their inclusion in this library.

You can also find Corey's NetLogo model featuring these shapes, along with animated versions, [here](nlogox/corey-brady.nlogox).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

here("svg", "corey-brady") |>
  dir_ls() |>
  path_rel(here()) |>
  create_svg_shapes_table()
```

### NetLogo Simplified

These shapes are simplified versions of NetLogo's original shapes, reducing the amount of nodes and paths to optimize performance in simulations while maintaining visual fidelity.

```{=gfm}
> [!NOTE]
> These shapes cannot be use in NetLogo directly due to their new structure. They are intended for use in external applications.
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

here("svg", "netlogo-simplified") |>
  dir_ls() |>
  path_rel(here()) |>
  create_svg_shapes_table()
```

### NetLogo Refined

These shapes are refined versions of NetLogo's original shapes, enhancing visual quality with smoother curves and improved details.

```{=gfm}
> [!NOTE]
> These shapes cannot be use in NetLogo directly due to their new structure. They are intended for use in external applications.
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

here("svg", "netlogo-refined") |>
  dir_ls() |>
  path_rel(here()) |>
  create_svg_shapes_table()
```

## Planned Features

Integration of [open emoji sets](https://github.com/svgmoji/svgmoji) and other popular icon collections as NetLogo-compatible vector shapes is planned for future releases. There is currently no fixed timeline for these additions.

If you are interested in contributing to this effort, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Technical Specifications

### Elements and Structure

See [NetLogo's XML documentation](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/XML-File-Format#turtle-shapes) for details on the supported elements and structure of turtle shapes.

### Canvas & Coordinate System

Each shape is drawn on a **300×300 pixel** canvas. The origin `(0, 0)` is located at the top-left corner.

[![NetLogo Turtle Shape Editor](images/netlogo-turtle-shape-editor.png)](https://docs.netlogo.org/shapes.html)

### Color Mapping

NetLogo turtle shapes use a fixed set of [base colors](https://docs.netlogo.org/dictionary.html#base-colors). The table below lists each color’s name, Hex code, NetLogo numeric code, and internal [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) integer representation, making it easy to convert colors between formats and ensure compatibility.
