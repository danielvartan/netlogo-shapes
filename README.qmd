## Overview

`NetLogo-Shapes` is a library of [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) [vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics). It provides scalable, editable versions of [NetLogo’s iconic shapes](https://docs.netlogo.org/shapes.html), making it easy to customize visuals for simulations and educational materials without loss of quality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `NetLogo-Shapes` is an independent project with no affiliation to [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) or its developers. If you use any shapes from the NetLogo libraries, please give proper credit to the original creators. See [NetLogo's licensing information](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/blob/main/shared/resources/main/system/about.txt) for details.
```

## Usage

All shapes are located in the repository [`svg`](https://github.com/danielvartan/netlogo-shapes/tree/main/svg/) directory. These vectors are optimized for [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) standards, stripping unnecessary metadata to maintain the smallest possible file size.

The collection features all 230 shapes from [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org/) 7.0.3:

```{r}
#| include: false

library(here)
library(fs)

shapes <-
  dir_ls(here("svg", "netlogo-7-0-3")) |>
  path_rel(here())
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

library(htmltools)
library(stringr)

tags$table(
  tags$tr(
    tags$td(
      lapply(
        shapes,
        function(x) {
          tags$a(
            href = x,
            tags$img(
              src = x,
              alt = paste(
                x |>
                  basename() |>
                  str_remove("\\.svg$") |>
                  str_replace_all("-", " ") |>
                  str_to_title(),
                "Shape"
              ),
              width = "50"
            ),
            HTML("&nbsp;")
          )
        }
      )
    ),
    bgcolor = "#1e1e1e"
  )
)
```

## Technical Specifications

### Canvas & Coordinate System

Each shape is drawn on a **300×300 pixel** canvas. The origin `(0, 0)` is located at the top-left corner.

[![NetLogo Turtle Shape Editor](images/netlogo-turtle-shape-editor.png)](https://docs.netlogo.org/shapes.html)

### Color Mapping

The library uses the standard [NetLogo base colors](https://docs.netlogo.org/dictionary.html#base-colors). The table below maps these to Hexadecimal and NetLogo’s internal [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) integer format for cross-compatibility.

  path_rel(here())
